Consider Locale when doing toUpperCase and toLowerCase

Today I saw an unrelated topic in the internet
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/228477)
which made me aware that toLowerCase (and probably toUpperCase) may
behave differently on different systems (systems with different default
locale, i.e., language settings).

In order to avoid such kind of bugs, I centralize all toLowerCase and
toUpperCase in the TextUtils class and use Locale.ENGLISH by default.
